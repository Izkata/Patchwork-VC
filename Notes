==================== Perl-based (or refactored bash) plans:

pw push

pw pull           # Everything including "svn up"
pw pull --prepare # Lower-level command if you use your own "svn up" wrapper
pw pull --finish  # Lower-level command if you use your own "svn up" wrapper
("pw pull" === "pw pull --prepare; svn up; pw pull --finish")

pw sync

pw squash_svn

pw log               # master..branch
pw log --branches    # --all master..
pw log --all         # --all
pw branches          # Alias to "pw log --branches"

----------
All commands will take user/pass arguments for svn:

   pw pull
   pw --username svn_user pull
   pw --username svn_user --password svn_pass pull

Using these automatically includes "--no-auth-cache"

==================== Misc

Enabling rerere might help with the sync rebasing; a couple times back at the start I was
   repeating the same resolution, but that was generally after screwing up the repo during
   a pw-pull.  It hasn't happened recently, but keep in mind...

Split "squash_svn" into "squash" that takes a branch.  How it's been going, I'll want
   to squash master soon.

Master should always be a child of subversion, not share it.  After a squash_svn, it
   would otherwise have no parent and "pw log" will fail.  Auto "commit --allow-empty"
   if the sanity check fails?

==================== Alternatives

Direct ancestor test:  (part of sanity checks?)
   [ "$(git rev-list JournalRotation -1)" == "$(git merge-base master JournalRotation)" ]
