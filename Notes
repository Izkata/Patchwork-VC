==================== Current bash-function based one:

pw log
pw treelog
pw branches

pw sync

pw squash_svn

pw push
pw abort_push
# svn add/commit/etc here
pw post_push

pw pre_pull
pw pull # wrapper: pre_pull; svn up; post_pull
pw post_pull

==================== Perl-based (or refactored bash) plans:

pw push
pw push --abort
pw push --finish

pw pull
pw pull --finish
pw pull --all        # "svn up" wrapper

pw sync

pw squash_svn

pw log               # master..branch
pw log --branches    # --all master..
pw log --all         # --all
pw branches          # Alias to "pw log --branches"

==================== Misc

Instead of "master~1..", this may be a better revision selectior:  "master^!"

Enabling rerere might help with the sync rebasing; a couple times back at the start I was
   repeating the same resolution, but that was generally after screwing up the repo during
   a pw-pull.  It hasn't happened recently, but keep in mind...
